# Connector overview

Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] offers a rich set of connectors that allow you to connect to different types of data stores. You can take advantage of those connectors to transform data in dataflows or move a PB-level of dataset with high-scale in a data pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up a connection in Dataflow Gen2 or a data pipeline, the following prerequisites are required:

- A Microsoft Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../get-started/fabric-trial.md).

- A Microsoft Fabric enabled Workspace. [Create a workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md).

## Supported data connectors in dataflows

Dataflow Gen2 provide data ingestion and transformation capabilities over a wide range of data sources. These data sources include various types of files, databases, online, cloud, and on-premises data sources. There are greater than 145 different data connectors, which are accessible from the dataflows authoring experience within the get data experience.

The following connectors are currently available for output destinations in Dataflow Gen2:

- Azure Data Explorer
- Azure SQL

- Lakehouse

## Supported data stores in data pipeline

Data Factory in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] supports data stores in a data pipeline through the Copy, Lookup, Get Metadata, Delete, Script, and Stored Procedure activities. For a list of all currently supported data connectors, go to [Data pipeline connectors in Microsoft Fabric](pipeline-support.md).
